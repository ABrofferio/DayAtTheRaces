# DayAtTheRaces

This is a racing game built with JavaScript.

This project is currently incomplete.

Things to do:
-Allow someone to predict who the winner will be and check whether or not they're correct
-Give a score depending on how close the prediction was to the actual winner and tally the cumulative score for each session
-Get the winning declaration to work after using the reset button
